====== Geocache marker icons ======

On the [[.mainmenu:livemap|live map]] as well as on the list of your [[.mainmenu:lists|stored caches]] c:geo might show small marker icons in the corners of a [[cacheicons|geocache icon]] to provide additional information without the need to open the cache details.

The following table describes the meaning of these markers:

^ Marker (old) ^ Marker (new) ^ Name ^ Description ^
|{{ :marker_stored.png?nolink&20 |}}|{{ :marker_stored.svg?nolink&20 |}}|Stored|This geocache is stored offline in one of your lists.\\ This marker is only shown on the map but not in your lists, as it is logical that all caches in your lists are already stored. :-)|
