====== Geocache marker icons ======

On the [[.mainmenu:livemap|live map]] as well as on the list of your [[.mainmenu:lists|stored caches]] c:geo might show small marker icons in the corners of a [[cacheicons|geocache icon]] to provide additional information without the need to open the cache details.

The following table describes the meaning of these markers:

|Lower-Left: Personal Note||||
|{{ :marker_personalnote.svg?nolink&20 |}}|Personal note|A personal note is stored for this geocache.|
