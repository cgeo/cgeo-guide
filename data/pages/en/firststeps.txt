====== First steps with c:geo ======

<WRAP center round important 100%>
In order to use c:geo, you need an account of a geocaching platform of your choice. c:geo currently supports [[https://www.geocaching.com|geocaching.com]], an international commercial geocaching platform, as well as Opencaching platforms in several countries(e.g. [[https://www.opencaching.us|Opencaching USA]], [[https://www.opencache.uk|Opencaching UK]], and many more). Select a platform you would like to use, and upfront create an user account on their web page (Basic accounts are normally free of charge).\\ \\
Without an account for a geocaching platform c:geo will not work!

===== Getting started =====

If you start c:geo for the first time after installation, you will be directly taken to the following "Getting started" screen:
