<WRAP center round info 100%>
The icons shown in the top bar and the contents behind the overflow menu button are distributed dynamically based on your device resolution and screen orientation. Thus it might be possible, that more or less items can be found behind the menu button or instead shown as icons in the top bar on your device.\\
In case a menu entry is shown as an icon you can long press the icon to get a popup showing its function.

Tapping the icons in this section allows you to attach an image to your log in a fast way.

  * {{:ic_menu_camera.svg?nolink&30|}} will open the camera on your device to take a picture

Alternatively you can use the title bar menu option ''Attach image'' to add an image using the advanced menu, where you can also define the caption, description and select the scaling while adding the picture (see next chapter).

After an image has been added, a preview will be shown in the images section. You can use {{:ic_menu_delete.svg?nolink&30|}} to remove the attached picture and -if multiple picture are attached - use {{:ic_menu_reorder.svg?nolink&30|}} to change the order by dragging and dropping them.

To edit the picture details just click on them to open the detail window, where you can edit caption, description and scaling (see next chapter).

=== Edit image options ===

Selecting the menu option ''Attach image'' from the [[logging#top_bar_menu|top bar menu]] will open a new screen, where you can attach a picture to your log. You can also reach this view for already attached pictures by tapping on the preview picture on the log screen.

{{ :en:logging_attachimage.png?nolink&400 |}}

Selecting ''Existing'' opens a file selector and lets you pick an existing image from your gallery. Selecting ''New'' opens your device camera to take a new image (just as the quick icons described in the last chapter).

Afterwards you can write a caption and provide a description for the picture, which will be added to your picture on the cache log.
You can also (optionally) select to downscale your image to different pixel sizes to reduce the data amount being transferred when posting the log with your image.
