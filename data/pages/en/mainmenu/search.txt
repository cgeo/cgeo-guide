====== Search function ======

{{:main_search_default.png?nolink&100 |}}

The search menu provides several search functions as described below. All location and user based searches will provide a [[lists|list of caches]] as result, whereas the geocode search and the trackable search will directly open the resulting [[..:cachedetails|geocache details]] or [[..:trackabledetails|trackable details]].

<WRAP center round info 100%>
Basically all search functions will use all enabled geocaching platforms simultaneously and provide the result in a combined list across all geocaching services. This depends on the functions supported by the specific geocaching service as listed in [[settings#Services|the service setting menu]].
