This function allows to view the existing pocket queries and bookmark lists on the geocaching server and either show them as a [[lists|list]] or import the whole pocket query similar to [[..offline#gpx_import|importing a GPX file]].

After selecting this menu function the list of bookmark lists and pocket queries will be loaded from the server as follows:

{{:en:pocketquery.png?nolink&400 |}}

The list will show each existing pocket query or bookmark list with its name as title. The subtitle provides information about how many caches are contained in each query/list.
For pocket queries it will also contain the day the query was run and the remaining days the query will be available on the server.

The {{:ic_menu_save.png?nolink&20|}} icon can be used to import the whole pocket query / list onto one of your lists, the {{:abc_ic_search_api_holo_light.png?nolink&20|}} icon will open the pocket query /list for preview.
