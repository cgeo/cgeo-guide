The list will show each existing pocket query or bookmark list with its name as title. The subtitle provides information about how many caches are contained in each query/list.
For pocket queries it will also contain the day the query was run and the remaining days the query will be available on the server.

The {{:ic_menu_save.svg?nolink&20|}} icon can be used to import the whole pocket query / list onto one of your lists, the {{:ic_menu_search.svg?nolink&20|}} icon will open the pocket query for preview.
