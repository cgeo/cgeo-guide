After selecting this menu function the list of pocket queries will be loaded from the server as follows:

{{:en:pocketquery.png?nolink&400 |}}

The list will show each existing pocket query with its name as title. The subtitle provides information about how many caches are contained in each query, the day the query was run and the remaining days the query will be available on the server.

The {{:ic_menu_save.png?nolink&20|}} icon can be used to import the whole pocket query onto one of your lists, the {{:abc_ic_search_api_holo_light.png?nolink&20|}} icon will open the pocket query for preview.
