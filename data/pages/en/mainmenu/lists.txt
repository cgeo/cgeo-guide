====== Stored caches ======

{{:main_stored_default.svg?nolink&100 |}}

This menu lists the Geocaches currently stored on your mobile device for offline use. For a better geocaching experience, c:geo allows you to organize your stored geocaches into multiple lists.

You can always access the information in these lists, even if you have no network connection. All caches in these lists are stored offline with all relevant information. However some additional information (log images) is only available offline if you enabled this in the [[settings#offline_data|corresponding settings]].

===== Cache list =====
{{anchor:cache_list:}}

<WRAP center round tip 100%>
Tap on the following links to get information about the [[..:cacheicons|Geocache Type Icons in c:geo]] and [[..:cachemarkers|Geocache marker icons in c:geo]], which are used on the cache lists.
</WRAP>

<WRAP center round info 100%>
The same list view is also used in the result of [[search|search functions]], for showing a list of caches on the [[livemap|live map]] and for displaying the content of [[pocketquery|pocket queries]].\\
In this case - of course - caches on the list might not (yet) be stored in an offline list.
</WRAP>

{{:en:lists_1_en.png?direct&400 |}}


The list will show you the title of each geocache in the first row. Below this there is a subtitle showing its geo code, the D/T rating, the cache size, the [[..:basicmembers|premium-only]] status (if applicable) and whether the cache is stored offline (helpful if you are looking at a [[search|search result]] list). If enabled in [[settings#offline_data|settings]] the subtitle will also show the names of all lists, where the cache is stored.\\
The color stripe on the very left indicates (in addition to the markers on the cache type icon) whether this cache is <color #22b14c>found</color>, you posted that you <color #ed1c24>did not find</color> it or you have a <color #ff7f27>pending offline log</color> for it.

If the title is <del>strike through</del> the corresponding cache is temporarily disabled, if the cache title is additionally shown in <color #ed1c24>red letters</color> the cache is archived and no longer available.

A short tap on one of the list entries will open the [[..:cachedetails|details]] of this cache, a long tap will open a [[lists#context_menu|context menu]] with direct access to some cache related functions.

The information shown for each geocache on the right side of the list view is explained in the table below:

^Icon ^ Description ^
|{{ :en:lists_distance_direction.png?nolink&100 |}}|Distance and direction towards the cache based on your current location ([[..:basicmembers|basic members]] of geocaching.com will only see a limited information here)|
|{{ :en:lists_fav_vote.png?nolink&100 |}}|The number shows the amount of favorite points (geocaching.com) or recommendations (opencaching) of this cache.\\ The background color represents the average [[http://gcvote.com|GCVote]] rating of the cache:\\ Green = Good rating (>3,5 stars)\\ Brown = Average rating (between 2,5 and 3,5)\\ Red = Bad rating (<2,5 stars).\\ If there is no color shown the cache does not have any votes yet or is not supported in GCVote (GCVote does currently only support geocaching.com caches).|
|{{ :en:lists_trackableinfo.png?nolink&100 |}}|The symbol is a marker which is only shown if the cache contains trackables. The number right next to it is the amount of trackables listed in this cache.|

==== Load more option ====

If the list you opened is created from a [[.search|search result]] or a [[.pocketquery|pocket query view]] there will be a button at then end of the list labeled ''Load more caches (Currently: XX)'' showing how many caches have currently been loaded to the list and tapping on it will load more results / pocket query entries.


==== Context menu ====
{{anchor:context_menu:}}

At a long tap on one of the caches on your list, the following context menu will be opened, providing you access to some direct actions on this cache:

{{ :en:lists_cache_contextmenu.png?direct&400 |}}

^ Menu item ^ Description ^
|Compass|Opens the compass to directly navigate to this cache.|
|Navigate|Opens the complete [[..:navigation|navigation options]] to select one of the supported navigation methods to this cache.|

|Remove|Delete this cache from your current list.|
|Move to different list|Move this cache onto another list.|
|Copy to different list|Copy this cache onto another list but keep it also on the current list.|
|Refresh|Update the cache details with data from the geocaching server|


===== List menu =====
{{anchor:list_menu:}}

<WRAP center round info 100%>
The icons shown in the top bar and the contents behind the overflow menu button are distributed dynamically based on your device resolution and screen orientation. Thus it might be possible, that more or less items can be found behind the menu button or instead shown as icons in the top bar on your device.\\
In case a menu entry is shown as an icon you can long press the icon to get a popup showing its function.
</WRAP>

==== Sorting ====
{{anchor:sorting:}}
Sorting settings are reachable via the options menu by clicking the sort-entry {{:ic_menu_sort_alphabetically.svg?nolink&30|}}.

If a sorting method other than automatic has been selected, it is shown as a header line below the title bar. By tapping this header line, the sorting settings can also be reached (similar to [[..:cachefilter|Cache Filtering]]). 
A long tap on this indication will reverse the sort order. 

{{ :en:lists_sorting.png?direct&400 |}}

<WRAP center round tip 100%>
Selecting the same sorting option twice will allow you to reverse the order in the sorted list (e.g. sorting by name will then sort from Z -> A instead of A -> Z).
</WRAP>

^ Menu item ^ Description ^
|Automatic sorting|Will sort as follows:\\ 1. Default sorting by distance\\ 2. If list contains only events, the list is sorted by event date\\ 3. If list contains a cache series with similar names, the list will be sorted by cache name.|
|Count on Inventory|Sort according to the amount of registered trackables in the cache|
|Date Hidden|Sort by hidden date of the cache.\\ //(If your list does only contain event caches, this will be automatically used as default sorting.)//|
|Date Logged|Sort by the date you logged the cache|

|Size|Sort by size information of the cache.|
|Status|Sort by status of the cache.|
|Terrain|Sort by difficulty rating of the cache.|

The sorting mode you selected will be kept for each individual list.
</WRAP>

==== Select mode ====
{{anchor:select_mode:}}

{{ :en:lists_selectmode.png?direct&400 |}}

After activating the selection mode your list will be shown with check boxes in front of each cache as shown in the picture above. This allows you to mark some caches on your list by tapping on them and afterwards batch perform actions on the selected caches from the [[lists#manage_caches|Manage Caches]] menu (e.g. delete all selected caches).

Additionally you can now use the ''Invert Selection'' menu option to invert your current selection, which might be helpful if you want to select all except only some caches on your list.

Once you are done, use the ''Exit select mode'' menu option to leave the selection mode.

<WRAP center round tip 100%>
You can also quickly invoke the selection mode while on a list, by swiping from left to right on a list item.

This can either be one of the supported map types in c:geo or a supported third party app like [[utilityprograms|Locus or maps.me]].

==== Manage Caches ====
{{anchor:manage_caches:}}

{{:en:lists_managecaches.png?direct&350|}}{{ :en:lists_managecaches_select.png?direct&350|}}
