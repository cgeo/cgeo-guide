While the map screen is shown your mobile device will for your convenience not automatically switch off any longer. You have to leave this screen in order to return to automatic (timed) switch-off for power conservation. Of course, manually switching on and off your mobile device still works as usual.

{{ :en:livemap_2.png?direct&400 |}}

<WRAP center round info 100%>
The icons shown in the top bar and the contents behind the overflow menu button are distributed dynamically based on your device resolution and screen orientation.
