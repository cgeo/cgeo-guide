====== Home Screen======

This page describes the information shown on the home screen and the functions of the bottom navigation elements visible throughout the app.

The home screen shows your profile picture (derived from the geocaching website) as well as your find count and login status for all geocaching services you have activated in c:geo.

|{{:main_stored_default.svg?nolink&100|}}|[[lists|Stored Caches]]|View geocaches you have stored for offline use. You can also use stored geocaches for online caching, as a to-do list.

|{{:main_live_default.svg?nolink&100|}}|[[livemap|Map]]|Show a map centered on your current location, with nearby geocaches marked on it. You can drag the map to view geocaches in other locations. To see the map with up-to-date geocache locations, you need online network access.|

|{{:main_nearby_default.svg?nolink&100|}}|[[lists#cache_list|Nearby]]|List the nearby geocaches. Unlike the live map, this function creates an online query based on your current location, as acquired from GPS or the network. The query does not automatically update when you move. To use this function, you need online network access.|
