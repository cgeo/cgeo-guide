====== Geocache Details ======

The cache details pages provide you all information about a specific cache. They can be opened by tapping on a cache in a [[.mainmenu:lists|list]],from the [[.mainmenu:livemap#map_popup_window|live map]] or by direct [[.mainmenu:search|search]] for the geo code of a cache.

{{ :en:cachedetails_details.png?direct&300 |}}

The cache details are distributed over several tabs accessible by swiping from left to right or vice versa. Unless you changed this in the [[.mainmenu:settings#cache_details|settings]] the details tab will always open first.\\
At the [[cachedetails#bottom_section|bottom section]] of each tab you can see the name of the current tab and you can also use this to navigate between the tabs. The [[cachedetails#top_bar_menu|top bar menu]] is the same on all tabs.

You can see the complete order of the tabs in the table below. Tapping on the images in the table will open a larger version, tapping on the headline will directly take you to the relevant section in this user guide:

^ [[cachedetails#waypoint_tab|Waypoints]] ^ [[cachedetails#details_tab|Details]] ^ [[cachedetails#description_tab|Description]]^ [[cachedetails#logbook_tab|Logbook]] ^ [[cachedetails#logbook_tab|Friends/Own Logs]] ^[[cachedetails#inventory_tab|Inventory]] ^ [[cachedetails#image_tab|Images]] ^

===== Top bar menu =====
{{anchor:top_bar_menu:}}

{{ :en:cachedetails_topbar.png?direct&400 |}}

The top bar is available from all tabs and provides several functions related to the cache:

<WRAP center round info 100%>
The icons shown in the top bar and the contents behind the overflow menu button are distributed dynamically based on your device resolution and screen orientation. Thus it might be possible, that more or less items can be found behind the menu button or instead shown as icons in the top bar on your device.\\
In case a menu entry is shown as an icon you can long press the icon to get a popup showing its function, unless the double command is provided (short and long press), as in the case of the preferred and secondary navigator option)

^ Icon ^ Name ^ Description ^
|{{:ic_menu_waypoint_sync.png?nolink&40|}}|Copy waypoints|Will copy all self defined waypoints of this cache into the personal note. With this feature you can backup the waypoints you created for this cache into the personal note. As c:geo recognizes the used syntax such stored waypoints will be automatically recreated from the personal note.|
|{{:ic_menu_waypoint_delete.png?nolink&40|}}|Delete waypoints|This will delete the copied waypoints from the personal note.|
|{{:ic_menu_upload.png?nolink&40|}}|Upload to server|Upload the local personal note to the geocaching server.\\ :!: On geocaching.com this is a premium member feature.|

<WRAP center round info 100%>
If different cache notes exist on the server and locally in c:geo while the cache is refreshed, both notes will be kept and separated by ''- - -''.
</WRAP>

===== Logbook tab =====
{{anchor:logbook_tab:}}

{{:en:cachedetails_logbook.png?direct&300 |}}

The cache details can contain two different logbook tabs. The tab named ''Logbook'' contains the most recent 35 log entries of the cache, while the tab ''Friends/Own Logs'' contains all the logs of your geocaching friends (a server function of geocaching.com) as well as all your own logs for this cache.

On the top of the logbook you will find the logbook summary of the cache, providing information about which type of logs and how many of them have been posted for this cache.

Below you will see a scroll able list with the log entries, each containing the username, the log date, the log type, the total finds of the user and the log text.\\
Color markes indicate the different log type allowing an easy distinction between "good" log types (e.g. found, activated) and "bad" log types (e.g. Not found, Deactivated).

:!: In case the log contains spoilers, the logging user can decide to encrypt the log entry. In this case you can tap on the log entry to decode the log text.

Tapping on the username will open a context menu with owner related [[.mainmenu:search|search options]].

Long tap on the log text allows you to copy the text to your clipboard. Furthermore you can use it to trigger [[.mainmenu:utilityprograms|translating]] the log into another language.

===== Inventory tab =====
{{anchor:inventory_tab:}}

{{:en:cachedetails_inventory.png?direct&300 |}}

This tab shows the trackable inventory of the cache. The tab is only present if the cache contains trackables.

It will show the type icon and the name of the trackable. Tapping on a list entry will open the [[trackabledetails|trackable detail page]], providing more information about the trackable.

===== Image tab =====
{{anchor:image_tab:}}

{{ :en:cachedetails_images.png?direct&300 |}}

This tab contains the images available for the cache. It will contain all pictures from the cache description as well as all pictures attached to logbook entries available in the [[cachedetails#logbook_tab|logbook tab]].

:!:
This is not the same function as the cache gallery on the geocaching web page, as only the log pictures of the most recent 35 logs but not all are shown here.

Tapping on an image opens the picture in your default image viewer.

<WRAP center round tip 50%>
If the image contains coordinates in its header info, a small compass rose icon will be shown on the lower left corner of the image. In this case you can short tap or long tap on that icon to start your preferred or secondary preferred [[navigation|navigation]].
Long tap on the image itself will in this case open a context menu, where you can create a new waypoint with these coordinates.
