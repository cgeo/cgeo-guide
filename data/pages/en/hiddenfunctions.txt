====== Hidden functions ======

While we try to make every function of c:geo as accessible and self explanatory as possible, there are still some shortcuts and advanced functions, which you might not find right away.

All of these hidden functions are also explained in the relevant section of this user guide, but for those of you who are already familiar with all the main c:geo functions we additionally collected them here as it might enhance your usage experience:
