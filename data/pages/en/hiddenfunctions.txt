====== Hidden functions ======

While we try to make every function of c:geo as accessible and self explanatory as possible, there are still some shortcuts and advanced functions, which you might not find right away.

All of these hidden functions are also explained in the relevant section of this user guide, but for those of you who are already familiar with all the main c:geo functions we additionally collected them here as it might enhance your usage experience:

==== Manual config options in settings ====

Additionally, we have some very specific configuration options, which are relevant under certain circumstances only, and which we do not present in settings to keep them more legible. You can use settings => system => view settings to add or edit such settings.

^Key ^Type ^Default ^Usage ^Supported version
|autorenameDownloads |boolean|true|File names of maps downloaded with c:geo will be changed to a more legible form automatically, e. g. "berlin_oam.osm.map" will be changed to "Berlin (OAM)" | 2025.02.09-NB |

==== Other manual configuration ====

== Display name for downloaded map files ==

Every map downloaded with c:geo has a so-called companion file with additional info. This file has the same name as the map file, but with an additional "-cgeo.txt". This file holds extra info about the download, e. g. date & time of download to support the update functionality.

Starting with version 2025.02.XX (not yet published) you can edit the value of the "displayname" entry to change the name under which this map will be listed in c:geo (including sorting). This feature is supported in UnifiedMap only.
