The trackable details are distributed over several tabs accessible by swiping from left to right or vice versa. The details tab will always open first.
At the bottom section of each tab you can see the name of the current tab and you can also use this to navigate between the tabs. The top bar menu is the same on all tabs.

As not all [[loggingtb#supported_trackables|trackable brands]] are supported with all their functions, some tabs might be missing depending on the trackable brand.

<WRAP center round info 100%>
The icons shown in the top bar and the contents behind the overflow menu button are distributed dynamically based on your device resolution and screen orientation. Thus it might be possible, that more or less items can be found behind the menu button or instead shown as icons in the top bar on your device.\\
In case a menu entry is shown as an icon you can long press the icon to get a popup showing its function.
