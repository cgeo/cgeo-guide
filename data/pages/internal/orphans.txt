====== Page status ======

===== Orphaned pages =====

List of orphaned pages, which are not reachable by any link from other pages.
This means, that either these pages should be deleted (maybe created with typo?) or they need to be linked from another page to be accessible.

~~ORPHANSWANTED:orphans!internal~~  

Remark:
If everything is OK and complete, only ''start'' pages of each namespace will be shown here, until they have a back link from the sidebars in their language (as this is the only point where the start page is linked).
''sidebar'' documents of each namespace might show up as well, as they usually have no direct link pointing to them.
The page ''ebook'' will also be listed here, as it is a system internal page used for creating custom PDFs.

===== Wanted pages =====

List of pages, which are used as a link but not yet exist.
 
~~ORPHANSWANTED:wanted!internal~~  

Remark:
Normally the ''wiki'' namespace should not be shown here, as it is excluded in the report.
Somehow this does not seem to work?! FIXME
Furthermore I did not yet find out why ''mainmenu:livemap'' is listed here, as I could not find any links to it anywhere.



===== Valid pages =====

List of pages, which are existing and not orphaned incl. their amount of back links.
